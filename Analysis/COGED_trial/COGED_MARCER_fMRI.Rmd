# MARCER COGED fMRI Results
#### There are 143 participants that have completed scan session. 142 participants have at least some coged/nback in lab data (7306 was excluded due to not completing any coged/nback in and out of the scanner despite having IAPS data). 134 participants have at least some COGED scan data.
#### N.b. all error bars in this summary are 95% CIs

The higher the reward for the harder option, the less likely people are to choose the easier option (p = 0.069). The higher the load of the hard task is, the more likely people are to choose the easier option.
